V- Construct ecdatabase

V- Create entity
V- refactor to core subfolder
V- refactor to EntityCreationTest in core
V- non db created entity should be null
V- two db created entities should not be equal
V- refactor null check to use the id
V- introduce cbbase
V- a guid should be null when constructed
V- a guid should not be null when created
V- Two guids should be equal when constructed
V- Two guids should not be equal when created
V- Refactor guid test to subdirectory
V- Refactor guid creation test to guid test
V- introduce cbbase guid
V- refactor entity guid to use cbbase guid
V- An ECDatabase should have an entity it creates
V- An ECDatabase should not have an entity it does not create
V- A null guid should be the smallest
V- A created guid should be bigger than null guid
V- refactor guid comparison to only use == and <
V- An ECDatabase should not have a removed entity anymore
V- Refactor some test to EntityStoringTest from EntityCreationTest
V- An ECDatabase should return a valid pointer of the correct type when a component is added to an entity
V- An ECDatabase should return the correct pointer after the component was added to the entity and retrieved
V- Refactor to use EntityFactory
V- TestComponent in separate header for reuse
V- A ComponentsContainer should be constructable
V- It should be able to add component to componentscontainer
V- component should be retrievable from components container
V- Refactor vector of components to ComponentsContainer
V- A ComponentIndexGenerator should be constructable
V- A ComponentIndexGenerator should return 0 for first component generated index for
V- A ComponentIndexGenerator should return 1 for second component generated index for
V- A ComponentIndexGenerator should return 2 for third component generated index for
V- A ComponentIndexGenerator should return 0 if index requested of first added after multiple added
V- Refactor to ComponentIndexGenerator
V- A ComponentsContainer should retrieve an added component
V- A ComponentsContainer should retrieve correct component when multiple added
V- An ECDatabase should only allow an entity to have one of each type of component
-- An ECDatabase should return correct component when multiple are added of different types
-- What about getting a not yet added component from entity -> nullptr?
-- AddComponentToEntity should have constructor args
-- Entity Component System library
